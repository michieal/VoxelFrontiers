Introduction
-------

This software has different licensing depending on use case. While the goal of this software is to make an open
source engine freely available to the public, it does recognize that there will be instances where there will be
a use case that would require a different licensing style. With that in mind from the inception, I am making this
project dual licensed.


Free and Open Source Licensing:
-------
The primary reason for this project being open sourced is that I want anyone to be able to learn from it, and to
use it free of charge as intended. I believe in the ideals of FOSS, and I rather love playing games like this. And 
I want others to be able to enjoy this game like I have. Therefore this software product is Free and Open Source. 
(Free as in Libre.) 

All creative works (textures, etc.,) are CC-BY-SA 4.0. Please attribute the appropriate creator in a visible
section of your project / media / game / etc. 

And, while not required, if you want to, please mention us when you use a part of this project in your project. It 
would make us happy to see that we helped others.

The main open source license for the code, and the godot project, is GPL3, unless specified otherwise.

A quick and easy understanding:
-------
Any code that uses the `ApophisSoftware` Namespace is GPL3, with the exception of the Apophis Software Coroutines package,
as that is under the MIT license.

What are the licenses of code created in this project, but not directly by the project itself?
--------

This project makes use of code that has been Licensed under the MIT license. Almost all of the Godot Ecosystem is MIT 
licensed. That said, it's easier to qualify what has been created by this project and state that its license is GPL3.
