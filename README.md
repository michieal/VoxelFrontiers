# MCLPP Codeneame Mineclone Plus Plus

## What it is
Mineclone Plus Plus (MCLPP) is an engine designed to run the MineClone2 Minetest Game.
After having developed for the Mineclone 2 team, and realizing that the Minetest developers
were more than complacent to leave 5-10 year old issues unanswered, even after most of the 
developers had decided that it was a great idea, and had given their consent on the PR's 
that fixed said issues, that they would never merge the PRs. Instead, we watched them as a 
whole engage in blaming their engine's game developers "for shoddy, dumpster fire code" 
instead of making real and much needed inprovements to their engine.

So, I decided to step back from the main Mineclone 2 Development team, to work on this 
project. To give life to an engine that would help the game that I (and many others) love. 
And so, with a lot of prodding, and some pestering, from my good friend JoMW I decided to 
build this from just fanciful thoughts into a real, honest engine.

Initial versions of this project were created In Unity/C#. But, with the recent events, 
and Unity being a dumpster fire (as well as closed source, proprietary software) I have
moved the project over to the Godot engine (4.1.1 stable-mono-offical). Mineclone 2 is 
open source, this engine's code is open source, and Godot is open source. So, it all came
together as a perfect fit.
